# Doubleblind
A micro app to play double-blind tabletop games without the need of an umpire.

The app runs in a browser, you can check it out [here](https://zerozerozero.dd-dns.de/DB/index.html).

I created it to learn how use progressive web apps - apps that can
be installed on PC and on Android without the need of a app store. And I was interested how to use svg as a user canvas / component (aka the map). And finall I wanted to see web tech - not uing a third party library speeds up things quite a bit.
